g_ledger
========
the ledger remains largely the same
when delaying transactions, the delay is the on-chain rounds
when writing output, the output should be written in O(1) rounds to the parties (a.k.a. available next round) aking to F_state doing this -- for now immediate output
tick: the tick is still processed immediately, there is no O(1) delay when writing to other turing machines
send transaction: same thing, there's not waiting here O(1)
