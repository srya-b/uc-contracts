When a VAL is received at a player, we can't send ECHO to everyone immediately otherwise we override the message that's already in F_bd-sec
the todo list checks ONE F_bd-sec per activation and only sends relevant information to that party.

Round 1
=======
Dealer (1) VAL 	--> p1
				--> p2
				--> p3

bd-sec (D-->1): VAL
bd-sec (D-->2): VAL
bd-sec (D-->3): VAL

Round 2
=======
output p1:	poll bd-sec (D --> 1) ==> receive VAL(m)
			* modify TODO to send ECHO to party i on activation i (skipping self because it is redundant
output p1: ECHO --> p2

bd-sec (1 --> 2):
